<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="indent">When a young man enters upon the business of life,
he may have some indefinite idea of what he intends to
follow out to the close thereof; but he soon finds himself
surrounded by circumstances which control his
actions and business pursuits, and lead him into channels
of thought and industry that had not previously
entered into his philosophy. At least I have found it
to be so, and I have no doubt others have had a similar
experience. To become a lexicographer, certainly
never entered into my calculation, or even found a
place in the castle-building of my younger days; and
if a kind friend had suggested to me that I was
destined to fill such a position in life, I would simply
have regarded him as a fit subject for the care of the
authorities. This improbable event has now taken
place; and I present myself to the world as the compiler
of a language used in all parts of the world, and
yet understood connectedly but by few persons.</p>

<p class="indent">The rogue fraternity have a language peculiarly
their own, which is understood and spoken by them
no matter what their dialect, or the nation where
they were reared. Many of their words and phrases,
owing to their comprehensive meaning, have come into
general use, so that a Vocabulum or Rogue&#39;s Lexicon,
has become a necessity to the general reader, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiv" id="pageiv"></a>[pg&nbsp;iv]</span>
more especially to those who read police intelligence.</p>

<p class="indent">Occupying the position of a Special Justice, and
Chief of the Police of the great Metropolis of New-York,
where thieves and others of a like character
from all parts of the world congregate, and realizing
the necessity of possessing a positive knowledge of
every thing connected with the class of individuals
with whom it was my duty to deal, I was naturally
led to study their peculiar language, believing that it
would enable me to converse with them more at ease,
and thus acquire a knowledge of their character, besides
obtaining from them information that would assist
me in the position I occupied, and consequently be of
great service to the public. To accomplish this task
was no mean undertaking, as I found that it required
years of diligent labor to hunt up the various authorities,
and these when found proved only partially available,
as much of the language in present use was unwritten,
and could only be obtained by personal study
among first-class thieves who had been taught it in
their youth. The difficulties surrounding it, did not
deter me from following out my resolution, and by
closely pursuing it, I had opened up to me a fountain
of knowledge that I could not have obtained if I had
not possessed a clear understanding of this peculiar
dialect. Experience has since demonstrated to me that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagev" id="pagev"></a>[pg&nbsp;v]</span>
any man engaged in police business can not excel
without understanding the rogues&#39; language, in the
study of which they will find this Lexicon of invaluable
service.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not, however, to policemen alone that this book
will be of service, as these cant words and phrases are
being interwoven with our language and many of them
are becoming recognized Anglicisms. It is not unusual
to see them in the messages of presidents and governors&mdash;to
hear them enunciated at the bar and from the pulpit,
and thus they have come to be acknowledged as
appropriately expressive of particular ideas; so that
while they are in common use among the footpads
that infest the land, the <i>élite</i> of the Fifth Avenue pay
homage to their worth, by frequently using them to
express thoughts, that could not, otherwise, find a fitting
representative. The vocabulary of the rogue is
not of recent date; although it is mainly made up of
arbitrary or technical words and phrases, while others
are of a purely classical origin. It is a language of great
antiquity, and may be dated back to the earliest days
of the roving gipsy bands, that infested Europe, from
whom the greater portion of it has been derived. It
might more properly be termed the Romany or Gipsy
language, adapted to the use of modern rogues in all
parts of the world, and in which the etymologist will
find words drawn from every known language. Some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi" id="pagevi"></a>[pg&nbsp;vi]</span>
of these words are peculiarly national, but as a general
thing the language of the rogue in New-York is the
language of the rogue the world over.</p>

<p class="indent">Among policemen, not only in this city but in different
parts of the United States, the cant language of
thieves is attempted to be used; but there being no
standard they are unable to do so understandingly,
and each one gives to the words the corrupted sense
in which he received it; thus speaking as it were, a
miserable &quot;<i>patois</i>,&quot; to the exclusion of the true
&quot;Parisian French.&quot; This departure from the true
meaning of the words used is mischievous in its tendency,
as it is calculated to mislead and bewilder, so
that rogues might still converse in the presence of an
officer, and he be ignorant of what they said. This I
have endeavored to correct, and although I may not
claim infallibility in these matters, yet I believe that
I have arrived at as high a degree of perfection as is
now attainable.</p>

<p class="indent">To the readers of the <i>National Police Gazette</i>, the
oldest and most reliable criminal journal published in
the United States, this work will prove invaluable, as
it will enable them to understand and fully comprehend
language that the editors and correspondents are
frequently compelled to use in order to convey the
idea as understood by rogues in general.</p>

<p>CONFIDENCE MAN. A fellow that by means of
extraordinary powers of persuasion gains the confidence
of his victims to the extent of drawing upon
their treasury, almost to an unlimited extent. To
every knave born into the world it has been said
that there is a due proportion of fools. Of all the
rogue tribe, the Confidence man is, perhaps, the
most liberally supplied with subjects; for every
man has his soft spot, and nine times out of ten the
soft spot is softened by an idiotic desire to overreach
the man that is about to overreach us. This is just
the spot on which the Confidence man works. He
knows his subject is only a knave wrongside out,
and accordingly he offers him a pretended gold
watch at the price of a brass one; he calls at the
front door with presents from no where, as none
could be expected; he writes letters in the most
generous spirit, announcing large legacies to persons
who have no kin on the face of the earth who cares
a copper for them. The Confidence man is perfectly
aware that he has to deal with a man who expects
a result without having worked for it, who gapes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
and stands ready to grasp at magnificent returns.
The consequence is, that the victim&mdash;the confiding
man&mdash;is always <i>done</i>. The one plays a sure game;
his sagacity has taught him that the great study of
the mass of mankind is to get something and give
nothing; but as this is bad doctrine, he wakes up
out of his &quot;brown study,&quot; and finds himself, in lieu
of his fine expectations, in possession of a turnip
for a watch, a cigar-box in place of a casket. The
Confidence man always carries the trump card; and
whoever wishes to be victimized can secure his
object by making a flat of himself in a small way,
while attempting to victimize somebody else.</p>

<p>DUN. A <i>very importunate</i> creditor. Dunny, in the
provincial dialect of several counties in England,
signifies <i>deaf</i>; to dun, then, perhaps may mean to
deafen with <i>importunate demands</i>; it may have
been derived from the word <i>donnez</i>, which signifies
<i>give</i>. But the word undoubtedly originated in the
days of one Joe Dun, a famous bailiff of the town
of Lincoln, England, who was so extremely active
and dexterous in his business, that it became a proverb,
when a man refused to pay, to say, &quot;Why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
don&#39;t you Dun him?&quot; that is, send Dun after him.
Hence it became a cant word, and is now as old as
the days of Henry VII. Dun was also the name for
the hangman, before that of Jack Ketch.</p>

<p>JACK KETCH. The hangman. This cognomen for

1682, we find in &quot;Butler&#39;s Ghost,&quot; p. 54, the following
lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Till Ketch observing he was choused,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And in his province much abused;</span><br />
<span class="i0">In open hall the tribute dunned,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To do his office, or refund.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>Jack Ketch had not been long appointed to his
office; for we find the name of his predecessor
(Dun) in the former part of this poem,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;For you, yourself, to act Squire Dun,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Such ignominy ne&#39;er saw the sun.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>The addition of &quot;Squire&quot; to Dun&#39;s name was an
evidence that he had executed some state criminal,
which, according to the custom of the times, accorded
to him that title. The predecessor of Dun
was one Gregory; from whom the gallows was
called the &quot;Gregorian tree,&quot; and by which name it
is mentioned in the prologue to &quot;Mercurius Pragmaticus,&quot;
tragi-comedy, acted in 1641:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;This trembles under the black rod, and he</span><br />
<span class="i0">Doth fear his fate from the Gregorian tree.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>Gregory succeeded Derrick, who flourished in the
year 1608, as we find in an old book of that time:
&quot;For he rides his circuit with the devil, and Derrick
must be his host, and Tyburn the inne at which
he will light.&quot; &quot;At the gallows where I leave them,
as to the haven at which they must all cast anchor,
if Derrick&#39;s cables do but hold.&quot;</p>

art, which is now out of use, though the
name remains. Instruction in the practice of this
art was given as follows: A purse and a pocket
were separately suspended, attached to which, both
around and above them, were small bells; each
contained counters, and he who could withdraw a
counter without causing any of the bells to ring,
was adjudged to be a &quot;Nypper.&quot; A nypper was a

called badger-cribs, shakedowns, touch-cribs, and
are variously fitted for the admission of those who
are in the secret, but which defy the scrutiny of
the uninitiated. Sometimes the casing of the door
is made to swing on well-oiled hinges which are not
discoverable in the room, while the door itself appears
to be hung in the usual manner, and well
secured by bolts and lock. At other times the entrance
is effected by means of what appears to be
an ordinary wardrobe, the back of which revolves
like a turn-style on pivots in the middle above and
below. When the victim has undressed himself
and got into bed with the woman, the thief enters,
and picking the pocket-book out of the pocket, abstracts
the money, and supplying its place with a
small roll of paper, returns the book to its place.
He then withdraws, and coming to the door raps
and demands admission, calling the woman by the
name of wife. The frightened victim, springing out
of bed, dresses himself in a hurry, feels his pocket-book
in its proper place, and escapes through another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
other door, congratulating himself on his happy
deliverance. He soon, however, finds out that he

others, minus their cash, pocket the dear-bought
experience.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A slubber de gullion named Harry Long, who
wanted to pass for an out-and-out cracksman, though
he was merely a diver.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whew! I know the kiddy like a copper, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
saved him once from lumping the lighter by putting
in buck. Why, he scarcely knows a jimmy from a
round robin, and Jack deserved the tippet for making
a lay with him, as all coves of his kidney blow the
gab. But how did you hare it to Romeville, Bell, for
I suppose the jets cleaned you out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I kidded a swell in a snoozing-ken, and shook him
of his dummy and thimble.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! Bell! you were always the blowen for a rum
bing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was no great quids, Jim&mdash;only six flimseys and
three beans. But I&#39;m flush of the balsam now, for I
dance balum-rancum for the bens.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bell here produced a rum bing, which at once made
her popular, and the nucleus of a host of admirers;
for, as it respects money, it is with rogues and their
doxeys as with all the rest of the world. Bell truly
justified the adage, that &quot;What&#39;s got over the devil&#39;s
back, goes under the devil&#39;s belly;&quot; for she gave a
general order to the rum-bluffer, to supply all the lush
that was called for by the company, at her expense;
and thereon there was a demand for max, oil of barby,
red tape, blue ruin, white velvet, and so forth, that
kept all the tapsters in the establishment in a state of
restless activity for the next half-hour.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bell, you&#39;re benish to-night,&quot; exclaimed Knapp,
who probably had a design on the purse, which the
course of events somewhat interfered with.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stubble your red rag,&quot; answered a good-looking
young fellow. &quot;Bell had better flash her dibs than
let you bubble her out of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, you joskin,&quot; retorted Jim; &quot;if you don&#39;t
stow your whids I&#39;ll put your bowsprit in parenthesis.
Ogle the cove, Bell&mdash;he wants to pass for a snafler in
his belcher tye, though he never bid higher than a
wipe in an upper benjamin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I may bid as high as your pintle, and make you
squint like a bag of nails,&quot; replied the intruder, &quot;though
you rub us to whit for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
&quot;Oh! it&#39;s all plummy,&quot; said Knapp, &quot;so you may cly
your daddles. But come, Bell, let us track the dancers
and rumble the flats, for I&#39;m tired of pattering flash
and lushing jackey.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bar that toss, Jim,&quot; said Bell, &quot;for you&#39;re as fly
at the pictures, as the devil at lying, and I would
rather be a knight of Alsatia than a plucked pigeon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This resolution produced a round of applause, which
was followed by another round of liquor&mdash;promptly
paid for by the lady of the rum bing, whose generosity
now so far extended itself, that she withdrew from Mr.
Knapp&#39;s protection, and, even without waiting to be
asked, deposited herself in the lap of him of the belcher
tye. She had scarcely asserted her title to the premises,
before it was disputed by another fair damsel,
who emphatically declared, that if the tenant in possession
did not immediately leave that, she would
astonish her mazzard with the contents of a &quot;nipperkin
of thunder and lightning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you do,&quot; returned Bell, &quot;I will fix my diggers
in your dial-plate, and turn it up with red.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mizzle, you punk.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well said,&quot; Madame Rhan, &quot;but the bishop might
as soon call the parson pig-stealer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You lie, you bat. I couple with no cove but my
own. But say, Harry, will you suffer yourself to be
made a two-legged stool of by a flag-about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! button your bone-box, Peg,&quot; replied Harry.
&quot;Bell&#39;s a rum blowen, and you only patter because
your ogle&#39;s as green as the Emerald Isle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s not half so green as yourself, halter-mad
Harry,&quot; retorted Peg; &quot;for you know if I wished to
nose I could have you twisted&mdash;not to mention any
thing about the cull that was hushed for his reader.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On a bench, close by the last speaker, was seated
Hitch, a police officer, who appeared to be quite at
home with the company, and to occasion no alarm or
misgivings; but the moment Peg mentioned the circumstance
of &quot;the cull that was hushed for his reader,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
he rose from the table, drew forth a pair of handcuffs,
and tapping Knapp&#39;s rival on the shoulder, playfully
whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Harry, my lad, the game&#39;s up; hold out your
wrists for the ruffles.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There they are, Mr. Hitch, though I suppose you&#39;ll
be asking me in a week or so to hold out my gorge for
a Tyburn tippet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">These proceedings naturally drew a crowd around
the parties concerned; but though all sympathized
with the prisoner, and the minion of the law was without
any assistant, yet there was not the slightest attempt
at a rescue, or even the least disposition manifested by
the captive of a desire to escape.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only nine months on the pad, and to be up for
scragging! What a pity!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s too young&mdash;he hasn&#39;t had his lark half out;
and it&#39;s like making a man pay a debt he don&#39;t owe,
to twist him before he has gone the rounds.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;ll die game for all that! Poor fellow! he takes
it like a glass of egg-nog.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! Mr. Hitch! isn&#39;t it out of order, and he so
green? You ought to give a chap a year to ripen for
the hemp.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do, Hitch, give him a little longer rope, and take
him in his regular turn. You&#39;re sure to have him,
you know, when his time&#39;s up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O! stubble it, George. Hitch can&#39;t, or he would;
for he never hurries a cove when it&#39;s left to himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s a fact, my kiddies,&quot; exclaimed the officer,
who seemed pleased at the compliment; &quot;but the
commissioner wants Harry, and so, of course, I must
pull him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m satisfied, whatever comes of it,&quot; added the prisoner.</p>

<p class="indent">Bell whispered in the officer&#39;s ear: &quot;Couldn&#39;t you
let him pike if I come down with a thimble and ten
beans?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A watch and ten guineas?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I might if you paid on delivery.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ready&#39;s the word.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Warehawk, then, and follow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hitch departed with his prisoner, followed by Bell;
but in a few minutes the latter returned and whispered
to Knapp:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your client has slipped the darbys, and his name&#39;s
Walker. Here&#39;s a flimsy, to lay low and bottle your
gab.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The flash-panny was now in the full tide of successful
operation&mdash;two thirds of its patrons being about
three sheets in the wind, and none of them perfectly
sober. In one corner there was a mill, wherein the
combatants hit the wall more frequently than they hit
each other. In another, two blowens were clapper-clawing
each other for a bob-cull, who was seconding
both parties, and declaring that the winner should
have him. Here a snafler lay snoring on a bench,
while a buzman, just half a degree less intoxicated,
was endeavoring to pick his pocket. There, three
cracksmen were engaged in a remarkably animated
dispute on the state of the country. Under almost
every table might be seen a son or daughter of Adam,
luxuriating in the realms of Nod. But the bulk of the
company were amusing themselves in a dance; for
one of the fixtures of the establishment was an Irish
piper, who, by the way, was a little fortune to it, for
every one treated Pat.</p>

<p class="indent">The dance was yet in its fullest vigor, when Hitch
returned and called Bell to one of the tables.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bell&quot;, said he, &quot;I have been looking for you more
eagerly than any of your lovers for several months
past&mdash;though I found you at length by an accident.
What have you done with the bloke?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Me, Hitch? Why, I have neither seen or heard
of him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, Bell, it&#39;s no use our wasting time in small
talk. You were with him the last night he was heard
of.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
&quot;Not I, faith, Hitch. Bring me the book, and I&#39;ll
swear No to that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How then came you by his super?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blast the super! for I fear it has got me into a
muss.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I take you to Newgate for it, Bell, it will be apt
to get you into a halter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then it will save me from the Bay fever, or
dying in the gutter; for all such as I am must draw
one of the three chances.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Make me your confessor, Bell, without any equivocation
or drawback, and I may stand between you
and Jack Ketch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what about the stone-jug?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That depends upon circumstances. Is the bloke
living or dead?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Living, for all I know to the contrary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know all about him, Bell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I do, may I cly the jerk at a drag; be trussed
in a Kilmainham garter, and fall to the surgeons.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it may be so,&quot; said Hitch, musing; &quot;for if
you knew all, half the world would have known it before
this time. However, Bell, you can supply a link
or two in the chain of evidence, so give me the particulars;
and remember, if you tell me a lie I will smell
it as it comes out of your mouth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Just then the guests of the Crooked Billet were interrupted
by an uproar in the street.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some swells on a lark,&quot; exclaimed lawyer Knapp;
&quot;dub the jigger and let them in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And Jim was right; for on the jigger being dubbed,
in staggered four bloods, who were sufficiently top-heavy
to be ready for any thing. Two of the newcomers,
who prided themselves on &quot;knowing the
ropes,&quot; while their companions were green from the
fens. Immediately on their entrance, this hopeful addition
to the convivial party already assembled, began
to exhibit their &quot;tip-top education&quot; by squaring off
for a fight, pattering flash, and ordering in lush. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
fact, they out-heroded Herod, for they proved themselves
to be yet greater blackguards than the poor
rogues whom they were so emulous to imitate. And
yet they were &quot;gentlemen,&quot; who would have been
shocked at the touch of a mechanic, though they gloried
in doing things up nutty, like pickpockets and
highwaymen. But they were not such knowing kiddies
after all, though they considered themselves bang
up to the mark; for suddenly one of them cried out
that he had lost his purse; and then they all discovered
that they had lost every thing they had which
was fairly removable. Thereupon there was a devil
of a muss, generally, with vociferous calling for the
police. The four fellows who had the four worst hats,
exchanged them <i>sans ceremonie</i> with the strangers,
while a couple of fogle-hunters tore off the skirts of
their coats to mend their breeches. To finish their
spree, by and by in rushed the police, and, on the
charge of an elderly, responsible-looking cracksman,
hurried the bloods off to the nearest station-house.
What rascally things are policemen! Alas! and alack!
just about as rascally as all the rest of the world.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES.</h2>

<p class="indent">Tim Sullivan buzzed a bloke and a shakester of a
reader. His jomer stalled. Johnny Miller, who was
to have his regulars, called out, &quot;cop-bung,&quot; for as
you see a fly-cop was marking. Jack speeled to the
crib, when he found Johnny Doyle had been pulling
down sawney for grub. He cracked a casa last night,
and fenced the swag. He told Jack as how Bill had
flimped a yack, and pinched a swell of a spark-fawney,
and had sent the yack to church, and got half a century
and a finnif for the fawney.</p>


<p class="h3">TRANSLATION.</p>

<p class="indent">Tim Sullivan picked the pockets of a gentleman and
lady of a pocket-book and purse. Tim&#39;s fancy-girl stood
near him and screened him from observation. Johnny
Miller, who was to have a share of the plunder, called
out to him: &quot;Hand over the stolen property&mdash;a detective
is observing your man&oelig;uvres.&quot; Sullivan ran immediately
to his house, when he found Johnny Doyle
had provided something to eat, by stealing some bacon
from a store-door. Doyle committed a burglary last
night, and disposed of the property plundered. He
told Sullivan that Bill had hustled a person, and obtained
a watch, and also robbed a well-dressed gentleman
of a diamond ring. The watch he sent to have
the works taken out and put into another case, or the
maker&#39;s name erased and another inserted; the ring
realized him fifty-five dollars.</p>

<h3>THE GAMBLER&#39;S FLASH.</h3>

<p class="center">WORDS FREQUENTLY USED BY GAMBLERS AMONG THEMSELVES, SOMETIMES
IN GENERAL CONVERSATION, AND SOMETIMES WHILE AT PLAY.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>A</h3>

<p>A GOSS. The card that has won three times in one
deal.</p>

<p>ANTI-GOSS. The card that has lost three times in
one deal. It is sometimes called a &quot;hotel.&quot; For
instance, a gambler who has been playing, finally
gets &quot;broke;&quot; but the love of play which from habit
has become a second nature in him, causes him to
linger behind to see the luck of others at the table.
Being &quot;dead broke,&quot; he borrows from a brother
gambler money enough to pay his hotel or boarding-house
bill. While looking on at the game an anti-goss
occurs, and thinking that the fourth time is sure
to win, he stakes the money he has borrowed to pay
the hotel, boarding-house, or washerwoman&#39;s bill,
whichever it may be, and he loses. The exclamation
among gamblers would then be, &quot;There goes
his hotel.&quot;</p>

<p>ARTIST. One who excels as a gamester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span></p>

<h3>B</h3>

<p>BANK. Without a party to play against, there can
be no faro-playing. The player must play against
some body, and that some body is a party of one or
more, who hire rooms, and own gambling instruments.
The gambling concern is owned by them,
and the servants, from the negro at the door who
answers to the touch of the bell, to the gentlemanly
&quot;picker-up,&quot; are in their pay, and act entirely in
accordance with their instructions. The capital
which the owners invest in this gambling co-partnership
is called the &quot;bank,&quot; but the amount varies
greatly. Some banking concerns are not worth over
$100, while others are worth $100,000. It is sometimes
easy to break a bank of limited capital, but
to make bankrupt the other is almost an impossibility.
The necessity of a large capital is apparent.
If four or six parties seated at the table should have
$50 each on the table, and four of the six should
win and the other two lose, then the bank in five
minutes would be $1000 the loser. The bank must
be always prepared to lose a thousand or two of an
evening, they knowing well enough that it will all
come back to them before the game closes.</p>

<p>BANKER. The man who puts the money up to be
played for. The owner of the bank.</p>

<p>BETTER. A party who enters a gambling-saloon,
takes his seat at the table, and commences to play,
is a better.</p>

<p>BETTING ON TIME. This frequently occurs when
the character of a party is such that he can be
trusted to pay the money he borrows or the debts
he incurs. If his character is good in this respect,
then he will be permitted to play after he is
&quot;broke,&quot; if it occurs that he should be the loser
when he rises from the table. This is betting on
time. The same thing is done in Wall street every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
day by speculating brokers. In Wall street gambling
there are the &quot;bulls&quot; and the &quot;bears,&quot; the
object of the one being to raise stock above its
actual value and then dispose of it, while the other
party depresses it below its value and then purchases
it. Nothing of this sort, however, occurs among
the professional gamblers, who locate in Broadway
and some of the down-town streets running from it.</p>


<h3>C</h3>

<p>CALLING THE TURN. When there is one turn,
say 4, 6, and 8, and the player calls 4, 8, the caller
loses; but if on the other hand it should be the
cards he calls, then he wins, and is paid four to one.
When a man calls both, he wins and loses on the
same turn. In the last turn the player can win
three ways. He can copper, call, and play the winning
card. He can double the limit of the game,
which is the privilege of the player on the last turn.</p>

<p>CAPPER. A man who sets at the table and plays,
but neither wins nor loses. He is there only for
the purpose of swelling the number of players, so
that the game won&#39;t hurry through too quickly,
thus giving the actual player proper time to consider
the game and study the moves he should
make.</p>

<p>CAPPER. A man in the employ of the bank, who
pretends to be playing against it, and winning
large amounts. Some gambling-houses in New-York
keep two sets of cappers all the time; one set goes
on at ten in the morning and retires at six in the
evening, when the night-set comes on. Thus the
game is continually going on; no matter when a man
entered, he finds the game in full blast, and there
never is any necessity to start it because of a fresh
arrival. Professional gamblers drop to cappers very
quickly. Cappers usually want to make too big
bets&mdash;that is, make too heavy bets. As a general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
thing they want to bet with the red checks, which
represent $5, putting down ten or twenty at a time.</p>

<p>CASHING. This is getting the money from the bank
for the checks or chips, if the player has any left on
hand when he stops playing.</p>

<p>CAT HOPP. Is when there is one turn left in the
box of the same denomination. For instance, two
jacks and a five; or three cards in the box, and two
of a similar count.</p>

<p>CHANGING IN. Handing in your money for the
chips.</p>

<p>CHIPS or CHECKS. The chips or checks are round
fancy pieces of ivory of the size of a half dollar, and
a trifle thicker. These represent money, and are
received from the dealer to play with in exchange
for money. They are much easier to handle, and
the dealer can see at a glance how much money is
bet on a card. The color of the chips indicate the
value they represent. There are three colors,
namely, white, red and blue. White chips represent
twenty-five cents, or one dollar, according to
the house. Red chips represent five times the value
of the white chips. Blue chips represent $25, $50,
and $100. A hundred dollar chip is the highest
&quot;fish&quot;, as the gambler calls it.</p>

<p>CHOPPING. A card which commences to win and
lose alternately, is called chopping, and to commence
to lose and win alternately, is anti-chopping.</p>

<p>COLD DECK. This is generally done in short cards, or
short games. A pack of cards is shuffled, and just as
they are about to be dealt out, another pack is substituted.
This is sometimes done by faro-players.
The dealer having shuffled the cards, or having got
another party to do it, drops the cards at his feet,
and lifts the packed cards from a handkerchief on
his lap. He calls on Sambo, the darkey waiter, to
lift a check at his feet, and thus the evidence of his
guilt is carried off unobserved. When cleverly
done, the trick can not be discovered. One gambler
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
often plays this trick on another, and hence it derives
the expressive name of &quot;cold deck.&quot;</p>

<p>COPPER. A card can be played to win or lose, at
the option of the player. If he wishes to play any
particular card to lose, he places a penny on top of
the money he stakes. This signifies that he plays
it to lose; hence it is called coppering.</p>

<p>CRAPS or PROPS. A game peculiar to Boston. Sometimes
it is played with shells, and sometimes with coffee-beans,
but more generally the former, as they can
be loaded. If four shells are not at hand, four coffee-beans
answer the same purpose. It is a substitute
for the dice. Thousands of dollars have been
lost on this game, but as it has not received the
same condemnation from the moral portion of the
community that dice has, Bostonians patronize it.
There is no other reason why that city alone should
patronize it. The game is so childish, that it is ten
times more dangerous than any other, and gamblers
have no trouble in &quot;roping in&quot; men to play at it,
who would faint with horror at the sight of a pack
of cards.</p>

<p>CUE. Is a calculation which confirmed gamblers are
guided altogether by in playing. They know that
after three cards of one denomination have gone out,
they can not be split.</p>

<p>CUE-BOX. The cue-box is an exact representation
of the lay-out of the cards on the table. The player,
by looking at the cue-box, can instantly see what
cards have been drawn from the box, thus relieving
him of the trouble of keeping the run of the cards
in his head. For instance if four jacks had been
drawn from the box, and a player should place his
money on the jack, they being all drawn, he could
not win or lose.</p>

<p>CUE-KEEPER. The man who keeps the cues or
marks, so that a player knows by looking at it,
which card is in and which is out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span></p>

<h3>D</h3>

<p>DEALER. The party who deals out the cards, receiving
generally for his services from ten to twenty
per cent of the profits of the game from the banker.</p>

<p>DOUBLE CARD. Two cards of the same denomination.</p>


<h3>E</h3>

<p>EVEN. The player who trys to make up what he has
lost. Having lost $50, he stakes another $50, perhaps
his last, for the purpose of getting back what
he had lost, to be even with the bank, or get broke
in the attempt.</p>


<h3>F</h3>

<p>FLAT. One who has no knowledge, or an imperfect
knowledge, of gambling. No matter how much a
man may know of all the sciences in the world, if
he is ignorant of gambling, and should enter a
gambling-room, the players would smile and say,
&quot;There&#39;s a flat,&quot; a man who did not know any thing.</p>


<h3>G</h3>

<p>GAFF. The gaff is a ring worn on the fore-finger of
the dealer. It has a sharp point on the inner side, and
the gambler, when dealing from a two-card box, can
deal out the card he chooses; some, however, are
smart enough to do this trick without the gaff. It
is now out of date, and the only city in which it is
now in use, is Baltimore. The gaff has been the
initiative idea of tricks of this character, and many
improvements, of which it is the foundation, have
been discovered by sharpers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span></p>

<h3>H</h3>

<p>HOCK. The last card in the box. Among thieves a
man is in hock when he is in prison; but when one
gambler is caught by another, smarter than himself,
and is beat, then he is in hock. Men are only
caught, or put in hock, on the race-tracks, or on the
steamboats down South. In a hock-game, if a man
hits a card, he is obliged to let his money lie until
it either wins or loses. Of course there are nine
hundred and ninety-nine chances against the player,
and the oldest man living never yet saw him win,
and thus he is caught in hock.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>ITEMS. Items derives his name from looking at
a party&#39;s hand, and conveying to the opposition
player what it contains by signs. This is Item&#39;s
occupation. A looking-glass is sometimes used,
sometimes signs which mutes would only understand,
and sometimes the signs are agreed upon and
known only to the parties interested.</p>


<h3>L</h3>

<p>LAMAS. High chips or checks representing $25, $50,
and $100. There are no $1000 lamas, for the simple
reason that with $100 chips any amount of
money can be laid on the table.</p>

<p>LAY-OUT. The &quot;lay-out&quot; is composed of all the
cards in a suit, commencing at the ace and ending
at the king. These cards are posted upon a piece
of velvet, which can be spread upon the table whenever
the dealer chooses to open the game. When
play has commenced, each player places his stake
upon any card he may choose, and as the cards are
drawn from the box, his bet is determined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
LEAVING OUT. When a dispute arises, a referee
of outsiders or lookers-on, is appointed, to whom
the difficulty is referred, and whose decision among
professional men is decisive.</p>

<p>LITTLE FIGURE. Ace, deuce, and tray.</p>

<p>LOOK-OUT. The look-out is the man who is supposed
to keep every thing straight, and see that no
mistake is made, and that the dealer does not neglect
to lift any money that he has won.</p>


<h3>M</h3>

<p>MARKER. Marking is frequently done in playing the
game of faro. It is something put down on the
card, a pencil, a knife, or any thing, to represent any
amount of money the player pleases. He says: I bet
$5, $10, $50, or $100, as it suits him and his finances.
This saves him from delaying the game by going
through his pockets for the exact money he wants.
When the deal is out, he settles.</p>


<h3>N</h3>

<p>NUDGE. This is not often practised at the game of
faro; it is applicable, as its name implies, to cribbage
and similar games. The office of a nudger is
to touch an associate with his feet. These touchings
are signs, which are denominated nudging.</p>


<h3>P</h3>

<p>PALMING. Concealing cards in the palm of the
hands.</p>

<p>PARLIEU. Is to allow one&#39;s money to lie on the table
and double. For instance, the player puts $5
on the table, and it wins; instead of lifting it, he lets
the original sum lie&mdash;that is called a parlieu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
PICKER-UP. We frequently read of country-men
being &quot;roped&quot; into gambling-houses, but this occurs
from the ignorance of the reporters, who know nothing
of the language used by gamblers and sportsmen.
Gamblers of the higher grade in New-York,
never use the word &quot;roper-in.&quot; It is usually confidence-men,
ball-players, pocket book droppers, and
others attached to that fraternity. The roper-in
takes a man over to Brooklyn or New-Jersey, and is
an actor in the swindle; the picker-up takes his man
to a gambling-saloon, and there leaves him to be
enchanted, enchained, and allured by what he sees.
Sometimes he only gives the man he has picked up
his card, which will admit him to a gaming-house,
where he can play a card of another description.
The roper-in and the picker-up therefore should not
be confounded.</p>

<p>The picker-up is always a gentleman, in manners,
taste, dress, and appearance, and sometimes has the
superficial knowledge of a scholar. He is thoroughly
informed on all the topics of the day. He has seen
New-Orleans, knows all about it, and can talk of
the gallant defense made there from behind the cotton-bales.
He knows all about the evil results arising
out of the agitation of the slavery question.
He loves Boston and New-England, for it was there
he was born and spent his earliest and his happiest
days; it was the cradle and the birth-place of liberty,
and the world looked with unreserved delight
upon the efforts which the men of the East put
forth in the cause of freedom; he has spent many
happy years in the far West, its vast prairies, its
wide-spread, majestic forests, and mighty rivers,
and he can not help warming up when he reverts to
these themes, which moved the hearts of philosophers,
poets, and statesmen.</p>

<p>This is the picker-up. He first sees the man&#39;s
name on the hotel-register, and where he is from.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
He then sees him out, studies his character, and ascertains
his means and the object of his visit to the
city; and the picker-up, if smart, reads his victim
phrenologically without touching his head. Every
man has some weak point which can be played upon,
and the duty of the picker-up is to discover it. It
does not take him long generally to get a stranger
to visit a gambling-hell. Very many of the servants
of hotels are in the pay of pickers-up&mdash;the duty of
the servant being to get information concerning
guests, which his employer can use.</p>

<p>PIKER. Is a man who plays very small amounts.
Plays a quarter, wins, pockets the winnings, and
keeps at quarters; and never, if he can help it,
bets on his winnings.</p>

<p>PLAYING ON VELVET. Playing on the money
that has been won from the bank.</p>

<p>PRESS. When a man wins a bet, and instead of lifting
and pocketing the winnings, he adds to the original
stake and winnings, it becomes a press.</p>

<p>PRIVATE GAME. So called because the flat is led
to suppose that no professional gamblers are admitted,
and thus he is the more easily duped.</p>

<p>PUBLIC GAME. A game where any body can be
admitted.</p>


<h3>R</h3>

<p>REPEATER. For instance, when a card wins or loses
at one deal, and the same thing occurs the next deal,
it is a repeater.</p>

<p>ROUNDER. One who hangs around faro-banks, but
does not play. In other words, a loafer, a man who
travels on his shape, and is supported by a woman,
but does not receive enough money to enable him to
play faro. Gamblers call such men rounders, outsiders,
loafers.</p>

<p>RUSSER. A big player.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span></p>

<h3>S</h3>

<p>SHOE-STRING. When a man bets a small amount
and runs it up to a large amount, it is called a
shoe-string.</p>

<p>SHORT CARDS. By some called short game. A
game of seven-up or cribbage. For instance, &quot;Have
you been playing faro to-night?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;What
then?&quot; &quot;I have been playing short cards.&quot;</p>

<p>SKINNING. A sure game, where all who play are
sure to lose, except the gamesters.</p>

<p>SLEEPER. A bet won by the bank or a better,
which has been overlooked and lies on the table
without a claimant.</p>

<p>SPLIT. When two cards come alike. For instance,
if two jacks should come out, the banker takes one
half of the money.</p>

<p>SQUARE GAME. When cards are dealt fairly, and
there is no cheating.</p>

<p>STRIPPERS. Cards cut at the sides for the purpose
of carrying on a skinning game.</p>

<p>STUCK. When a man has lost all his money, and is
trying on the last throw to retrieve his loss and he
is beat, then he is stuck.</p>

<p>SUCKER. A flat; one who can play cards, but does
not know all the tricks and traps in gambling.</p>

<p>SUMMER GAME. Playing merely for amusement.</p>

<p>SUMMER GAME. Playing a game for the benefit of
another person with his money.</p>

<p>SUPPER CUSTOMERS. Some of the fashionable
gambling-houses have free suppers for their customers;
this is done to induce the better class of gambling
merchants to patronize the house. But there
are some men who frequent these houses and take supper,
but never play. When such a one is asked if
he is going to take a hand in, his usual answer is,
&quot;Thank you, sir, I&#39;m a supper customer to night.&quot;</p>


<h3>T</h3>

<p>TELL-BOX. The tell-box is an improvement on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
gaff, and has a fine spring attached to it. The object
is to cheat the dealer. The dealer plays with a pack
of cards which the player has had a chance to
handle, and he rubs the backs of certain of them
with sand-paper. The rough card adheres to the
smooth one, and the fact that it does not move a
hair&#39;s breadth in the box enables him to know the
card that is covered, and he plays accordingly. He
can also play in the same manner with a new pack
of cards without sanding them, as certain cards require
a greater amount of ink than others.</p>

<p>THE POT. The six, seven, and eight.</p>

<p>TRICKS. When a player takes the cards from his
opponent that counts. If the queen is put down
and king follows, which is higher, then the queen
is taken. That is a trick.</p>

<p>TRICK GAMES. Such games as whist, where tricks
count.</p>


<h3>Z</h3>

<p>ZODIAC. This word has degenerated into Soda. It
means the top card in the box.</p>

<h3>TECHNICAL WORDS AND PHRASES,<br />
USED BY<br />
BILLIARD-PLAYERS.</h3>

<hr/>

<p>ATTITUDE. The position in which the player stands
while at the billiard-table, when about to strike the
ball. The acquisition of a good attitude is a matter
of first importance to the new beginner. It is almost
impossible to lay down fixed rules in this particular,
as the peculiarities of height and figure
would render the rules that would be excellent in
one case, totally inapplicable in the other. Perfect
ease is the grand <i>desideratum</i>; and this is to be
acquired by practice, and a close observation of the
best players.</p>

<p>BANK. When the player makes his own ball hit any
of the cushions before striking the object-ball.</p>

<p>BILLIARD-SHARP. A class of character not tolerated
in respectable saloons. As a general thing,
the billiard-sharp is a retired marker, who fancies it
is no longer respectable to work for an honest living,
but that he is smart enough, and has learned
tricks enough at his former business, to enable him
to win as much money as he wants from the less experienced
amateurs of the game, who figure in his
vocabulary as &quot;the flats.&quot; He generally frequents
those establishments where one or two billiard-tables
are made the stall behind which some dishonest
occupation is carried on; and here he is at
home, and in his glory. He makes himself particularly
friendly with any one who will ask him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
&quot;take a drink,&quot; and in his assumed duties he fills
the offices of lounger, runner, talker, player, sponge,
shoulder-hitter, and referee.</p>

<p>He is also a runner, and sort of travelling blower to
second-rate manufacturers of billiard-tables. These
men supply him with clothes, to enable him to
mingle in respectable society, and allow him an
enormous per centage for every billiard-table sold
to a stranger through his agency. In addition to
this, it is his business to pull down the reputation
of such manufacturers as despise and scorn the
means by which he earns his dishonest livelihood.
As soon as he has made &quot;a hit&quot; in one saloon, he is
off to another, and in this way goes the rounds of
the city until all the places which harbor him, are,
in his own phrase, &quot;played out.&quot;</p>

<p>Such a man is to be avoided as one of the worst
species of sharpers. He has a thousand pretenses
under which to borrow money, and will act as if
quite offended if refused. The stranger should avoid
all such men, and especially any one with whom he
is not well acquainted, who should ask him to play
for any given sum, &quot;just to give an interest to the
game.&quot;</p>

<p>BOWERY SHOT. When the balls played with and
at, are jarred together&mdash;a pushing shot.</p>

<p>BREAK. The position the balls are left in after the
shot.</p>

<p>BURST. A term chiefly used at pin-pool, when a
player has exceeded the number which is placed as
the common limit to the game, and must, therefore,
either retire from the game, or take a privilege of
another life.</p>

<p>CAROM. (French, <i>Carombolage</i>.) To hit more than
one of the balls on the table with your own. In
England this word has been corrupted to &quot;cannon.&quot;</p>

<p>COUNT. Is the reckoning of the game. Making a
count, is to make a stroke which will add some
figures to the player&#39;s reckoning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
DISCOUNT. When one player is so much the superior
of another, that he allows all the counts made
by his opponent to be deducted from his own reckoning,
he is said to &quot;discount&quot; his adversary&#39;s gains.
In &quot;double&quot; and &quot;treble discounts,&quot; twice and
thrice the amount of his opponent&#39;s gains are deducted
from the player&#39;s score. In no other game
but billiards are such immense odds possible. A
man of close observation, temperate habits, steady
nerves, and large experience, may give almost any
odds to an inferior player, and still have a fair
chance of success.</p>

<p>DOUBLET or CROSS. When the ball to be pocketed
is first made to rebound from the opposite cushion.</p>

<p>FOLLOW. When a player&#39;s ball rolls on after another
ball which it has impelled forward.</p>

<p>FORCE. When the player&#39;s ball retrogrades after
coming in contact with another.</p>

<p>FOUL STROKE or SHOT. Any stroke made in violation
of the known rules of the game.</p>

<p>FULL BALL, QUARTER BALL, HALF BALL,
FINE or CUT BALL, OWN or CUE BALL, and
OBJECT BALL. The &quot;object ball&quot; is the ball
aimed at; the &quot;own or cue ball&quot; is the ball directed
toward the &quot;object ball;&quot; the other terms relate to
the position in which the object ball is struck.</p>

<p>GERMANTOWNER. <i>See Bowery Shot.</i></p>

<p>HAZARD. To drive any of the balls into any of the
pockets.</p>

<p>HAZARD, DOUBLE. When two balls are pocketed
with the same stroke.</p>

<p>HAZARD, LOSING. When the player&#39;s ball is
pocketed by his own act.</p>

<p>HAZARD, TAKING A. A term used to express that
a player is so confident of making a certain hazard,
that he will undertake to do it, under penalty of
losing, in case he does not succeed, as many lives as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
he would have gained if successful. The phrase is
most frequently employed in two-ball pool.</p>

<p>HAZARD, WINNING. When the player pockets
either of the red balls, or his adversary&#39;s ball.</p>

<p>HUG. When any of the balls run close alongside of
a particular cushion, they are said to hug it.</p>

<p>JAW. When a ball is prevented from dropping into
a pocket by the cushions, which extend like jaws on
either side.</p>

<p>JUMP. When the player forces his ball by a downward
stroke to leap up from the table.</p>

<p>KILLED or DEAD BALL. When a ball in pool has
lost its lives, and its chances are not renewed by
privileges, it is said to be killed.</p>

<p>KISS. When the ball played with strikes another ball
more than once, they are said to kiss; or when two
balls, not played with, come in contact.</p>

<p>LONE GAME. A game in which one of the parties
is an experienced player, and the other a novice&mdash;the
former having the game in his own hands.</p>

<p>MISS. To fail striking any of the balls upon the table.</p>

<p>MISS-CUE. When the cue, from any cause, slips
off the ball without accomplishing the intended
stroke.</p>

<p>PLAYING FOR SAFETY. When the player foregoes
a possible advantage, in order to leave the balls
in such a position that his opponent can make nothing
out of them.</p>

<p>PLAYING SPOT-BALL. When the player is not
limited to the number of times he may pocket the
red ball from the spot.</p>

<p>PRIVILEGE. When a player loses the lives, or
chances, which were given to his ball on its entry
into the game, and desires to purchase another
chance from the other players, he asks a &quot;privilege.&quot;</p>

<p>SCRATCH. When a player wins a stroke or count
by accident, without deserving it, he is said to have
made a scratch.</p>

<p>STRINGING FOR THE LEAD. A preliminary arrangement,
by which it is determined who shall
have the choice of lead and balls.</p>

<p>TIMBER LICK. <i>See Bowery Shot.</i></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
